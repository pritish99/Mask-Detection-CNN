# Mask-Detection-CNN

This project was made with the intent of creating a machine learning application aimed at classifying whether the person infront of the camera has worn a mask or not.

The training was done with Cnn algorithm where the data input was of target size (64,64) pixels.

Convolution layers: 3

Units in Full Connection: 128

Activation function: ReLu and Softmax

Optimizer: adam

Loss funtion: sparse_categorical_crossentropy
